###Ternary Operator
PHP has another way of making short comparisons - the ternary operator ?:. Using this, we can make quick comparisons and return a result based on the comparison.

A comparison with the ternary operator would look like this:

```
$age = 22;
// [condition]?[value if true]:[value if false];
$is_adult = $age >= 18 ? true : false;

```
